        <h2 align="left"> 1&nbsp;Trump's visit to bolster trust</h2>
        <img src="fd1.jpg" class="fd" />
        By AN BAIJIE | China Daily | Updated: 2017-11-07 04:47
        Stage set for candid talks, positive results starting on Wednesday

        Beijing and Washington are expected to build a greater environment of consensus and boost mutual understanding on hot topics including trade and Korean Peninsula nuclear issues during US President Donald Trump's visit, which starts on Wednesday, analysts said.

        Trump's first state visit to China, at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, marks the first visit of a head of state since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last month. The congress elected the new CPC Central Committee and drew the blueprint for the nation's development in coming decades.

        Beijing has sent positive signals in recent days of being ready to exchange views with Washington on major issues in a candid manner amid the efforts of the world's two largest economies to reach more consensus and control disagreements.

        Zheng Zeguang, vice-foreign minister, said that the economic teams of both sides are keeping in close contact in preparation for the visit to push for resolution of problems in economic and trade areas in a constructive manner.

        The economies of the two nations are complementary - the US has a deficit with China in goods trade but a surplus in service trade, he said, adding that the two sides will make more progress in economic relations as long as they uphold the principle of mutual benefit.

        Representatives from about 40 companies are expected to accompany Trump to China and sign deals for billions of dollars in US investments, according to Bloomberg. Chinese investment would bring new jobs to hurricane-ravaged areas in Texas and the US Virgin Islands, said the report.

        The US should increase its exports and investment to China to address the issue of unbalanced trade, rather than restricting imports from China, because a trade war would result in losses on both sides, Zheng told reporters at a news briefing.

        The two countries have common interests in denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and stability in the region, he said, while calling on all sides to avoid activities or remarks that may lead to an escalation of tension.

        Jin Yong, deputy head of the School of International Studies at the Communication University of China, said that the visit will boost mutual political trust as it provides opportunities for the US president to better understand China's policies under the new era.

        The personal friendship between Xi and Trump is also expected to be a positive factor for bilateral ties given that the two leaders have maintained close and frequent contacts in the past months over major global and regional issues, he said.

        <div id="ldiv_zhuye">China's first nuclear reactor using Hualong One technology, a domestically developed third-generation reactor design, completed all the tests on Monday in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

            Jointly designed by two nuclear power giants, China General Nuclear Power Group and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), Hualong One pressurized water reactor is seen as another big step in the development of China's home-grown third-generation nuclear power facilities, after the country's first domestic CAP1400 pressurized water reactor successfully been made in September.

            After going through 30 tests in four days, the Hualong One reactor passed all the tests with its designs and performances rated superior to the required standards.

            In April 2015, the government approved the use of Hualong One technology to build two reactors unit 5 and 6 in Fuqing nuclear power plant in Fujian province, parallel with units 3 and 4 of Fangchenggang nuclear project in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.

            The Hualong One nuclear reactor, produced by Dongfang Electric Machinery Co Ltd (DFEM) for unit 5 and 6 in Fuqing, has a capacity of 1,200 MW.

            After decades of learning and innovation, China has mastered the independent design and manufacturing of third-generation nuclear power facilities and become a pioneer in nuclear sector worldwide.

            The country has actively promoted Hualong One at home and abroad. There are now four projects using Hualong One design under construction, including two reactors in Karachi, Pakistan. China is also seeking regulatory approval for the model in Britain.</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <div id="cdiv_zhuye">BEIJING -- Live streaming video online has become increasingly popular in China, however, some people worry that it may lead to problems including privacy leaks.

            According to a survey conducted by China Youth Daily, 78.4 percent of the 2,001 people interviewed worried about the risk of privacy leaks when they were involved in live streams.

            Zhang Lin, a university student, previously appeared in live streams hosted by others.

            "One of my friends was live streaming about freshmen at the beginning of the new semester. He suddenly turned the camera on me and introduced me to the audience," Zhang said, "I was so embarrassed to be involved."

            According to the survey, over 40 percent of those interviewed have appeared in other people's live streams.

            "The audience may be able to obtain my personal information, like my name, address or phone number, if they have my picture. That's why I don't want to take part," Zhang said.

            However, some people said they would be happy to be invited to join live streams.

            "I will join in a live stream if someone invites me and actively interact with audience," said Yue Xiaobo, who also hosts his own live streams.

            However, only 21 percent of the people interviewed said that they would be happy take part in a live stream after someone turns the camera on them, according to the survey. Over 70 percent said they would refuse to take part.</div>
        <div id="rdiv_zhuye">KUNMING - Police in Southwest China's Yunnan province have busted a cross-border drug trafficking ring and detained five suspects.

            Approximately 54 kilograms of methamphetamine were also confiscated, police in Kunming announced Monday.

            In early September, police received a report that a drug trafficking gang was planning to bring drugs into the country from Myanmar. Investigations showed that the suspects planned to drive across the border into Myanmar and return with the drugs.

            On Nov 1, police discovered the suspects had the drugs in Kunming and were preparing to send them to Xiantao, Hubei province.

            Police stopped a car at an expressway gas station near Xiantao and found 92 packs of drugs. Five suspects were caught at the scene.

            Further investigation is underway.</div>

        <h2 align="left"> 3&nbsp;Twenty-eight counties lifted out of poverty</h2>
        <img src="fd2.jpg" class="fd" />

        chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2017-11-07 09:20
        Twenty-six poor counties have got rid of the poverty label following the removal of Jinggangshan, East China’s Jiangxi province, and Lankao, Central China’s Henan province, from the poverty list in February.

        “Strict procedures and standards shall be followed when removing poverty-stricken areas from the list,” said Xia Gengsheng, member of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development.

        Four targets have to be met to be removed from the list. First, people living in poverty should be less than 2 percent of the total population if the area is in the central region, and less than 3 percent if they are living in the western region. Second, people mischaracterized as non-poor population should be less than 2 percent of the total population. Third, the percentage of people who have been left out of the survey must be under 2 percent. Fourth, over 90 percent residents should agree that their place has been lifted out of poverty. All the 26 counties meet the targets.

        Over 760 people from seven institutions including Renmin University were entrusted to conduct a field review and assessment on these counties one by one in July and August. Over 20,000 households in total were included, or around 1,000 households per county. The whole process was supervised by 65 experts from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

        Southwest University, serving as a third-party assessing institution, reviewed and assessed Nanbu county, southwestern Sichuan province. “We used remote sensing, compared satellite imagery of the place from 2014 to 2016 and its geographical features,” said Liao Heping, the university's professor. “We focused on the relatively poor area with weak infrastructure.”

        Thorough assessments were carried out in all the counties, including remote areas. Low-income families, people with severe diseases, and those with bad housing were all included in sampling.

        Great importance was paid to people living apart from their families, people living in remote areas, immigrants, and families with no labor force. The opinions of a wide range of people were consulted during the process. Over 1,400 questionnaires were handed out to cadres in villages and around 1,000 to cadres in counties.

        “We will continue to consolidate what we have achieved and make sure people who have just been lifted out poverty do not return to poverty again. Besides, we will strength poverty alleviation and help the rest shake off poverty,” said Zhang Gensheng, county Party secretary of Nanbu county.

        “After they remove the title of impoverished county, we will continue to strictly examine and assess those counties,” said Yang Lian, deputy director of the poverty alleviation group’s evaluation division.

        China plans to lift another 100 counties out of poverty this year.

        <h2 align="left"> 4&nbsp;China's railway department will start a new service</h2>
        <img src="fd3.jpg" class="fd" />
        China's railway department will start a new service to speed up the movement of goods during the upcoming Singles Day online shopping spree, in answer to the growing demand for logistics services.

        From Nov 11 to 20, the railway department will provide "storage to storage" service to e-commerce businesses and express delivery companies, according to a statement released by China Railway Corp, the national railway operator, on Monday.

        Railways usually provide "station to station" service, transporting goods from one station to another.

        Singles Day, which falls on Nov 11, is the world's largest online shopping festival. Last year, e-commerce giant Alibaba's retail platform, Tmall, received 657 million orders on Nov 11 worth a total of more than 120 billion yuan ($17.6 billion).

        The online shopping spree challenges delivery services. Customers have complained in the past that the deliveries were delayed.

        To answer the growing demand, a fast service will be provided by the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway this year, with a promise to deliver goods to customers in 10 hours.

        The service will rely on the "Fuxing" bullet train that runs 350 kilometers per hour and has reduced travel time between Beijing and Shanghai to four and a half hours. The company called the service the fastest express delivery service in China.

        A bullet train on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway will form a long-term partnership with e-commerce and delivery companies to transport goods, the company said.

        CRC will also set up special storage spaces to facilitate transport services for the shopping spree.

        The company launched the service for Singles Day last year. Some 170 bullet trains were used for express deliveries from Nov 11 to 20 last year, stopping at 505 cities. As with last year, services including same-day arrival, next morning arrival and arrival in one day will be offered.

        Last year, the railway department carried out bullet train express deliveries in cities having stops along the high-speed lines.

        Across China, 505 cities have stops along high-speed railways, including big cities and rural areas.

        China has the world's most extensive high-speed rail network, with 22,000 km of track currently in use.

        The total length of China's high-speed rail will reach 38,000 km by 2025, and 45,000 km by 2030, according to a plan released by the National Development and Reform Commission in July last year. friendship between Xi and Trump is also expected to be a positive factor for bilateral ties given that the two leaders have maintained close and frequent contacts in the past months over major global and regional issues, he said.
