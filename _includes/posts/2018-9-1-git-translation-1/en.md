While decentralized version control like Git has a lot of momentum right now, they still seems to have a reputation of being more complex than their centralized siblings, like SVN. I’m guessing one reason for this is that we tend to explain Git by comparision: When you’d do X in SVN, you’d do Y in Git.

I think we should instead talk about Git in terms of what it really is: **A purely functional data structure**. Learning to expertly use Git means learning how to manipulate that data structure.

If you’re not familiar with purely functional data structures, this might not seem too helpful. Turns out, we need only go briefly into this subject in order to gain the needed insight, so lets quickly explore this topic before bringing the discussion back to Git.

### Preliminiaries

A functional data structure is essentially an immutable data structure: its values never change. However, unlike for instance C#’s `ReadOnlyCollection`, which has no operations to e.g. insert into it, functional data structures do support operations like insertion or deletion, they are just not in-place. Instead these operations are handled by creating an entirely new updated structure.

For example, a typical list might look something like the value `[3,2,1]`. If this list is mutable and we perform the operation of inserting the value `4` at the front (head) of this list it now looks like `[4,3,2,1]`. It has been modified in place and has become the new value. The old value `[3,2,1]` is lost to us. Someone else who was looking at this list now sees the value [4,3,2,1] instead. If that someone was in the process of iterating through that list, they now get a nice exception.

In the functional model this does not happen. Instead, when we insert `4` into the list, it creates a new value `[4,3,2,1]`, without modifying the original list. Both the values `[4,3,2,1]` and `[3,2,1]` now exist, and anyone else who was looking at the list `[3,2,1]` still sees that value.

You might be thinking this seem very inefficient. If we have access to both the lists `[4,3,2,1]` and `[3,2,1]` we’d always have to store all those seven elements in memory right? Even though we might no longer be interested in the value `[3,2,1]`? In fact, the efficiency of functional data structures depend heavily on what operations are performed on them, and what internal representation is used (just like normal data structures do, of course, but with some different advantages, costs and trade-offs).

For (singly linked) lists, if all we’d like to do is do insertions at the front, we can handle this case efficiently, by storing the elements as below.

````
  +---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
  | 4 +--->+ 3 +--->+ 2 +--->+ 1 |
  +---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
    |        |
new list  original
````

We put the new value `4` in a new node, with a reference back to the rest of the list. The original value is represented with the existing reference, starting at the node for `3`. If someone else had a reference to that node, they would never notice an update had taken place (if the list has been doubly linked this wouldn’t be true). We can honestly say we have access to both the lists `[4,3,2,1]` and `[3,2,1]` independently even though they share elements in memory, as without operations for in-place modification, there is no perceivable difference.

In fact we could go further: If someone else would like to insert the element `9` at the head of `[3,2,1]`, they could do this independent of us, reusing the same elements.

````
              +---+      +---+    +---+    +---+
new list 1 -> | 4 +---+->+ 3 +--->+ 2 +--->+ 1 |
              +---+  /   +---+    +---+    +---+
                    /      |
              +---+/    original
new list 2 -> | 9 +
              +---+
````
We could of course store elements like this for a non-immutable list as well, but this is frought with danger: For instance, if we’d upate the element `3` in the list `[4,3,2,1]`, we’d also update it for someone seeing the list `[9,3,2,1]`, who might not like that one bit.

But… what if I really do need to update the element `3`, setting it to, say, `5`. What then? We’ll, since we’re not allowed to perform any in-place updates, we’ll have to copy some nodes into the updated list. The result of all three operations might look like this:

````
                +---+    +---+
updated list -> | 4 +--->+ 5 +----+
                +---+    +---+     
                                    
                +---+    +---+    +-+-+    +---+
  new list 1 -> | 4 +--->+ 3 +--->+ 2 +--->+ 1 |
                +---+  / +---+    +---+    +---+
                      /    |
                +---+/  original
  new list 2 -> | 9 +
                +---+
````

If we start at each pointer, going backwards, we see that this simultaneously represents all the four values `[4,5,2,1]`, `[4,3,2,1]`, `[9,3,2,1]` and `[3,2,1]`. If we’re indeed interested in storing all these values simultaneously, this representation is in fact much more compact than using mutable lists.

Purely functional data structures can be quite useful in multi-threaded programming, as changes from different threads will not interfere with each other.

### Getting Git
Now how is any of this relevant to Git and version control? Well, in a version control system what we want to accomplish is this:

- To update our code base with new versions, keeping old versions available.
- Collaborating on a single code base without updates interfering with each other in an unpredicable way.

Purely functional data structure lets you

- Update data structure while keeping the old value of that data available.
- Updating a structure in one place without interfering with someone elses updates of that structure.

If your’re now thinking functional data structures might seem like a good representation for a version control system, you’d be right. In fact, I’d even go so far to say I Git basically is a purely functional data structure, with a command line client that allows you to perform operations on it.

To complete the analogy, we need to replace what above was numbers with **commits**. Git commits are independent copies of your entire working state at point in history; a full snapshot of your working directory. What we called list in the example we could call a history in Git.

Let’s say we have a repository containing commits `A`, `B` and `C` in that order, in the `master` branch. We’ve told Git to store the entire state of our working directory three times during development.

We can represent this state of development as the history `[C,B,A]`. In reality each commit will have metadata like a commit message, but we’ll disregard that for simplicity as it doesn’t matter. In graph form:

````
+---+    +---+    +---+
+ C +--->+ B +--->+ A |
+---+    +---+    +---+
  |
master
````

### Commiting
If we perform another commit, this is the same as adding to the head of this history. Git’s even uses the name HEAD for the currently active commit.

````
+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
+ D +--->+ C +--->+ B +--->+ A |
+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
  |        |
master   master^
````

When git performs a commit it moves the current branch pointer for us, and makes `master` point to the history `[D,C,B,A]`. We can still refer to the history `[C,B,A]` by the name `master^`, the parent of `master`. Anyone else who was working in that state will not notice our changes.

### Amending
If you’ve used Git, you’re probably aware that you can update your latest commit by using `commit --amend`. But can you really update a commit? In fact, you cannot. Git simply creates a new commit and moves your branch pointer to it. The old value can still be found using `git reflog`, and can be referred to by its hash value (in this case I arbitrarily used `ef4d34`). The situation would look like the following.

````
          +---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
ef4d34 -> | D +--+>+ C +--->+ B +--->+ A |
          +---+ /  +---+    +---+    +---+
               /     |
          +---+    master^
master -> | E |
          +---+
````

### Branching
As you can see above, every time you do a `commit --amend` you essentially create a new branch (there is a fork in the repository graph). The only thing branching does is really to introduce a new name we can refer to commits with. We can even take the discarded commit `ef4d34` and create a branch pointing to it, using the command `git checkout -b branch ef3d34`

````
          +---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
branch -> | D +--+>+ C +--->+ B +--->+ A |
          +---+ /  +---+    +---+    +---+
               /     |
          +---+  master^
master -> | E |
          +---+
````

Typically we branch in Git by creating a new name for our current `HEAD`, but if you understand Git as a functional data structure, you realize there is nothing stopping you from creating a branch at whatever commit in the tree you’d like.

### Rebasing
When we in our list example updated a node further back in the list, we had to add back each node in the list preceding the updated element (in our example this was the single node `4`, but could have been any number of nodes). In Git, this is called replaying commits, and the command for performing this operation is called rebase. To update and old commit we add the `-i` flag to perform what in Git is called an interactive rebase.

Say we want to update the commit `C` with a new commit message. We do this by checking out the commit `D`, and using `git rebase -i C`.

````
> git checkout D
> git rebase -i C
````

This opens the same editor Git uses for commit messages with something like the following list of commands:

````
pick cd3ff32 <C's commit message>
pick a65a671 <D's commit message>

# some helpful comments from git
````

If we change the command for commit C to edit, Git will allow us to edit that commit before replaying the subsequent commits.

````
edit cd3ff32 <C's commit message>
pick a65a671 <D's commit message>
````

When we save the file and close it, git will begin a rebase. It will stop immediately at our commit C to allow us to edit it.

````
Stopped at cd3ff32... <C's commit message>
You can amend the commit now, with

        git commit --amend

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

        git rebase --continue
````

Basically, the message says it all. We’re free to edit the commit as we’d like. We then call `commit --amend` to create the updated commit, and continue with the rebase instructions using git `rebase --continue`. The rest of the commits will just be replayed one after the other as we chose the command `pick` (unless you end up with a merge conflict, in which case Git will stop and let you fix it before proceeding). Our complete repository now looks like the following.

````
          +---+    +---+
rebased ->| D'+--->+ C'+
          +---+    +---+
                         
          +---+    +---+   +---+    +---+
branch -> | D +--+>+ C +--->+ B +--->+ A |
          +---+ /  +---+    +---+    +---+
               /     |
          +---+  master^
master -> | E |
          +---+
````
The above graph should look familiar to you I hope. Hopefully you also understand why Git’s rebase command creates all new commits. Git is a functional data structure, and is not allowed to change any of the existing commits.

Since rebase introduces a new chain of commits, we’d expect to be able to have essentialy arbitrary control over how this new chain looks. And of course, we do: `rebase -i` allows us to re-order, squash or delete commits, as well as introduce new ones at any point, for instance to split up a commit into parts, even starting at some other point in the repository (using the `--onto` flag). The standard rebase workflow of forward-porting local changes on top of updates from a remote branch is just a special case of the more general power of rebase.

### Merging
So far we havn’t mentioned merging. Git allows us to merge two branches into one

````
        +---+
      --+ X |
+---+/  +---+
| M |
+---+   +---+
      --+ Y |
        +---+
````

Merging introduces a bit more complexity to our model. Instead of our history being a tree, it is now an acyclic graph. This doesn’t really change much, but its worth noting, that while rebasing has a reputation of being complex, only the merge command introduces additional conceptual complexity.

Rebase can be understood in terms of just applying new commits in a new direction. Merge is a fundamentally different operation. A data structure where you can combine two parts into one like this even has a special name: They are said be to confluently persistent. (Another name for functional data structures are persistent. I’ve avoided this term not to confuse it with the notion of storage on persistent media like a physical disc.)

### Conclusions
Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can accomplish.

In fact, looking at things this way, I think Git is in fact conceptually much simpler than for instance SVN. The only reason that Git might be perceived as more complex is that this simplicity allows us to actually implement more interesting  orkflows.

If you’ve ever felt like Git is intimidating remember its simple structure, as well the fact that in a functional data structure, anything that has been inserted into it is never really lost, and can be recovered. (Check your `reflog`)
